      You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and
      beautiful, piece of text. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum,
      but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also
      be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400
      pounds. Ok? Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he
      starts leaking to the press! I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum,
      but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also

      pounds. Ok?
