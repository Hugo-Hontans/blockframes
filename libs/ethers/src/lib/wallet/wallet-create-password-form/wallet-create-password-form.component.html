      Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next
      webpage?! I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's
      unbelievable. You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I
      don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina.
